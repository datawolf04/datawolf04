## Bio

I'm a Data Scientist with project management and cross-functional team leadership skills using technical tools including R, Python, and Git. Utilizing these skills, I have worked with 9 collaborations across many different STEM fields. My favorite thing about my work is when I can sink my teeth into an interesting technical problem, whether it is figuring out what some data is telling me or drafting a paper, talk, or diagram which can help me explain some interesting idea that I have found. Under this username, I've been spending time on personal/hobby projects. I also have a professional username [`@sfwolfphys`](https://github.com/sfwolfphys), and you can find me there as well as on [sfwolfphys.github.io](https://sfwolfphys.github.io).

## Projects (Some professional and some personal)
- I have used network analysis and networks to describe many systems including:
	- [Social Networks of students in classrooms](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-022-00465-z). As a part of this project, I also contributed to the [`concorR` package](https://github.com/ATraxLab/concorR)
	- [Ways of sorting physics problems](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.8.020116)
	- [Response patterns on physics exams](https://www.compadre.org/Repository/document/ServeFile.cfm?ID=14851&DocID=4998)
- I have applied [survival analysis techniques](https://doi.org/10.18084/1084-7219.25.1.165) to describe student pathways through college.
- I've been doing other work, including #TidyTuesday visualizations, and have been posting about them [on my pages site](https://datawolf04.github.io)
