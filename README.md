## Bio

I'm seeking Data Science or Data Engineering roles at Computer and Technology companies and am the perfect fit for these role because I have project management and cross-functional team leadership skills using technical tools including R, Python, and Git. Utilizing these skills, I have worked with 9 collaborations.

In my role as team leader, I was responsible for training junior team members in using R, Python, and Git, in addition to getting them familiar with the context of the project. Then I supported them as they worked on their project, setting deadlines, monitoring progress, and preparing them to share the project with appropriate stakeholders.

- High-level technical, statistical, and computer skills with experience working with R, Python, Jupyter, Mathematica, bash script, LATEX, Cluster Computing, PowerPoint, and Excel, as demonstrated by 25 peer-reviewed publications and 32 national conference presentations and 1 software package.
- Strong communication skills in the area of presenting scientific data and concepts combined with the ability to create a diverse team-oriented environment as demonstrated by teaching college physics courses across the undergraduate curriculum to classes ranging in size from 3 students to over 100 students at 4 institutions utilizing active, interactive learning techniques.
- Scientific leader with experience working independently, and with teams, utilizing a broad scientific knowledgebase, as evidenced by working with 9 collaborations across multiple STEM disciplines.
